# Joke Bot – Python API-Based Chat Bot

## Overview

This is a simple terminal-based chatbot that tells you a random joke using the JokeAPI (https://jokeapi.dev). The program continuously prompts the user until they type "quit", allowing them to fetch jokes as many times as they like. It was created to practice using APIs in Python and build interactive terminal apps.

## Key Features

- Fetches real-time jokes from an online API
- Simple command-based input (type "joke" or "quit")
- Error handling for API failures
- Clean console output with user and bot interaction

## What I Learned

This was one of my first projects using an external API. I learned how to:

- Send HTTP GET requests using the `requests` module
- Parse JSON responses in Python
- Handle errors and failed API calls
- Build an interactive loop-based chatbot

It was a fun way to learn more about working with APIs and making Python apps feel more dynamic and connected to the internet.

## How to Run

Install the required library if needed:

```bash
pip install requests
