# Iris Flower Classifier (Decision Tree)

## Overview

This project uses a decision tree classifier from the `scikit-learn` library to classify iris flowers into one of three species: setosa, versicolor, or virginica. It’s built on the classic Iris dataset and is designed to give a simple, clear introduction to machine learning using Python.

## Key Features

- Loads and splits the Iris dataset into training and testing sets
- Trains a DecisionTreeClassifier using scikit-learn
- Predicts species of unseen iris flowers based on petal/sepal size
- Outputs prediction accuracy and sample predictions

## What I Learned

This was my first real machine learning project. Through it, I learned:

- How to load and explore datasets using `scikit-learn`
- How to split data into training and test sets
- How to train and evaluate a decision tree model
- How to make predictions on new data
- The importance of model accuracy and testing

It also gave me a better understanding of how supervised learning works, and how Python can be used to build and test real classifiers in just a few lines.

## How to Run

Install the required library:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn
