# Productivity Bot – Python CLI Assistant

## Overview

This is a multi-purpose productivity assistant built using Python. It helps users stay focused by offering a built-in timer, motivational quotes from a live API, and a simple reminder system. The bot interacts through a clean command-line interface and guides the user with friendly prompts.

## Key Features

- Set a focus timer (user-defined in minutes)
- Fetch real-time motivational quotes using the ZenQuotes API
- Add and view reminders in a session-based to-do list
- Conversational CLI interface with flexible command recognition
- Encouraging messages and minimalistic design

## What I Learned

This project pulled together a lot of what I’ve learned this summer:

- Structuring a full Python app using reusable functions
- Working with external APIs (`requests` and JSON parsing)
- Using `time.sleep()` to simulate countdown behavior
- Handling input validation and command shortcuts
- Creating a small but meaningful productivity tool

It also gave me the chance to build something that feels more interactive and useful — something I could actually see myself using.

## How to Run

Install the required library:

```bash
pip install requests
