# Python Contact Book

## Overview

This is a simple command-line contact book built using Python. It allows users to add, search, and display saved contacts during a single session. The main purpose of this project was to practice working with dictionaries and implement basic menu-driven logic through user input.

## Key Features

- Add a new contact by name and number
- Search for an existing contact by name
- View all saved contacts
- Menu interface for user interaction
- Built-in loop for continuous use until exited

## What I Learned

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of:

- Python dictionaries for data storage
- Function creation and modular logic
- Loops and input validation
- Building basic tools with real-world use cases

It also gave me hands-on experience writing code that's interactive and clean, which is important when scaling to larger applications.

## How to Run

Make sure Python is installed, then run:

```bash
python contact_book.py
