# Python: Person Class Interaction

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python through a simple `Person` class. The program interacts with the user by collecting basic personal info and responding with personalized messages, including a prediction of their age 10 years into the future.

## Key Features

- Uses a custom `Person` class with attributes like name, age, and mood
- Gathers user input to instantiate a new object
- Provides a greeting and future prediction using class methods
- Demonstrates basic principles of object-oriented thinking

## What I Learned

This was one of my first steps into object-oriented programming with Python. Through it, I learned:

- How to define a class with an `__init__` constructor
- How to use `self` to refer to instance attributes
- How to build and call methods within a class
- The difference between procedural and object-oriented structure

It also showed me how organizing code using classes makes it more scalable and readable.

## How to Run

Make sure Python is installed, then run:

```bash
python person_class.py
