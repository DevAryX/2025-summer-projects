# Age in 10 Years – Simple Python Prompt

## Overview

This is a basic Python script that asks the user for their name and age, then calculates how old they will be in 10 years. It was created as part of my early Python practice for the summer portfolio project, focused on understanding input, data types, and output formatting.

## Key Features

- Takes user input for name and age
- Adds 10 years to the current age
- Displays a custom message using string concatenation

## What I Learned

While this script is simple, it helped reinforce:

- Accepting and converting user input
- String and integer manipulation
- Formatting output clearly
- Laying the foundation for more advanced input-driven programs

## How to Run

Make sure Python is installed, then run:

```bash
python age_in_10_years.py
