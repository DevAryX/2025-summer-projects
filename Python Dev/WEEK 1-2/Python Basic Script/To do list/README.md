# To-Do List App (Python CLI)

## Overview

This is a simple command-line to-do list app built using Python. It lets the user enter tasks one by one and then displays all the tasks neatly once the user finishes. The purpose of this mini project was to practice working with lists, loops, and basic user interaction in a clean and minimal way.

## Key Features

- Continuously accepts tasks until user types "done"
- Stores tasks in a list
- Outputs a numbered list of all tasks entered
- Lightweight and beginner-friendly

## What I Learned

This project helped me apply some key concepts from Python:

- Using lists to store dynamic data
- Writing `while` loops and breaking them based on user input
- Handling string input and conditions cleanly
- Displaying a list of results using `enumerate` for neat output

It was a great reminder that even a few lines of code can create something genuinely useful.

## How to Run

Make sure Python is installed, then run:

```bash
python todo_app.py
