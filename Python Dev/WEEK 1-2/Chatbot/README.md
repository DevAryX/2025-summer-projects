# Mood-Based Chatbot (Python)

## Overview

This is a simple mood-aware chatbot built using Python’s input/output system. It asks the user for their name and current mood, then gives a response based on how they're feeling. The goal was to practice using conditional logic and build something that feels personal, even with minimal code.

## Key Features

- Greets user by name
- Asks how the user is feeling (happy, sad, stressed, etc.)
- Gives an empathetic or uplifting response depending on the mood
- Uses simple conditionals to simulate basic conversational flow

## What I Learned

This project helped reinforce how powerful even basic Python can be when it comes to interaction and logic. It made me think more about:

- Building user-friendly CLI programs
- Using conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Working with user input in a natural, conversational way
- Creating personalised responses through string concatenation

## How to Run

Make sure Python is installed. Then run:

```bash
python mood_chatbot.py
