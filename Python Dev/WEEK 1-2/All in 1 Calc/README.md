# Multi-Tool Python Calculator

## Overview

This project is a simple command-line calculator that includes four useful tools in one: a BMI calculator, a tip calculator, a currency converter, and an age-in-days calculator. It was built as part of my Python refresh during my summer portfolio challenge, focusing on strengthening core Python skills and creating beginner-friendly utilities.

## Key Features

- BMI calculator using metric input (kg and meters)
- Tip calculator for restaurant bills
- Currency converter with custom input rate
- Age to days calculator
- Menu-driven command-line interface
- Input validation and error handling

## What I Learned

This project helped me revisit essential Python concepts like:

- Functions and modular code design
- Type casting (`float`, `int`) and input validation
- Using loops and conditionals to control flow
- Exception handling using `try-except`
- Basic user interaction through console I/O

It also reinforced the importance of structuring small projects clearly and making them easy for others to use and expand.

## How to Run

Make sure Python is installed, then run:

```bash
python calculator.py
