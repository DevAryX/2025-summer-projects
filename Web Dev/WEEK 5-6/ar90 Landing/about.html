    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p style="max-width: 800px; margin: 1em auto;">
      Honestly? We were just tired of wireless earbuds that either looked good but sounded meh,
      or sounded great but looked like spaceship parts. So we thought... why not both? That’s how AR90 Ultra was born.
      A dream to mix luxury vibes with that crisp, studio-grade sound that makes you feel like you're in the booth with your favorite artist.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
    <p style="max-width: 800px; margin: 1em auto;">
      We don’t think audio should feel “meh.” It should feel like wow. Whether you’re sprinting through the city, zoned in on a deadline,
      or chilling like a villain at 2AM - AR90 Ultra rolls with you.
      Everything from the curve of the case to the squish of the silicone was picked with love and logic.
    </p>

    <h2>Made with Passion</h2>
    <p style="max-width: 800px; margin: 1em auto;">
      Designed in Scotland (aye pal!). Engineered globally. We test every product for durability, comfort, and sound reproduction.
      This isn't just tech — it's lifestyle craftsmanship.
